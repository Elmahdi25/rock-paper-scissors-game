# rock-paper-scissors-game
This is my first JavaScript project, and it's a rock-paper-scissors game. I handled a lot of fundamental basics such as 
variables, if-else statements, mathematical operations, scope (both local and global), error handling, and debugging. 
I also learned about JSON and its differences from JavaScript Object (JSO), as well as implementing local storage methods like setItem(), getItem(), and removeItem(). 
I hope you enjoy it and have fun playing!
